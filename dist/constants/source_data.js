It is said [[Malik_al-Ashtar|Mālik al-Aschtar|35|wiki]], a famous follower of [[Ali|ʿAlī ibn Abī Tālib|36|wiki]], encouraged during the [[Battle_of_Siffin|battle of Siffin|37|wiki]] with the expression, Ali's enemy [[Muawiyah_I|Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān|38|wiki]] kills the *Sunna*. After the battle, it was agreed that \"the righteous *[[Sunnah|Sunnah|39|wiki]]*, the unifying, not the divisive\" (\"*as-sunna al-ʿādila al-ǧāmiʿa ġair al-mufarriqa*\") should be consulted to resolve the conflict. The time when the term *sunna* became the short form for \"[[Sunnah|sunnah|40|wiki]] of the [[Muhammad_in_Islam|prophet|41|wiki]]\" (*sunnat an-nabī*) is still unknown. During the [[Umayyad_Caliphate|Umayyad Caliphate|42|wiki]], several political movements, amongst them the [[Shia|Shia|43|wiki]] and the [[Kharijites|Kharijites|44|wiki]] who rebelled against the formation of the state; led their battles in the name of \"the book of God (*[[Quran|Qur'an|45|wiki]]*) and the *Sunnah* of his Prophet\". During the [[Second_Fitna|second Civil War|46|wiki]] (680–92) the Sunna-term received connotations critical of [[Shia_Islam|Shi'i|47|wiki]] doctrines (*Tashayyu*'). It is recorded by Masrūq ibn al-Adschdaʿ (d. 683), who was a *[[Mufti|Mufti|48|wiki]]* in [[Kufa|Kufa|49|wiki]], a need to love the first two caliphs [[Abū_Bakr|Abū Bakr|50|wiki]] and [[ʿUmar_ibn_al-Khaṭṭāb|ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb|51|wiki]] and acknowledge their priority (Fadā'il).

It is also passed down by asch-Shaʿbī, that he took offensive at the hatred on [[Aisha|ʿĀʾiša bint Abī Bakr|53|wiki]] and considered it a violation of the *[[Sunnah|sunnah|54|wiki]]*."

Thus at-Tahāwī explains that *jama* is considered as true or right (*ḥaqq wa-ṣawāb*) and *furqa* as aberration and punishment (*zaiġ wa-ʿaḏāb*). Ibn Taymiyyah argues, that *jama* as opposite term to *furqa* inherents the meaning of *iǧtimāʿ* (\"Coming together, being together, agreement\").

The Ottoman scholar Muslih ad Din al-Qastallani (d. 1495) held the opinnion that *jama* means \"Path of the [[Sahaba|Sahaba|87|wiki]]\" (*ṭarīqat aṣ-ṣaḥāba*). The modern Indonesian theologican [[Nurcholish_Madjid|Nurcholish Madjid|88|wiki]] (d. 2005) interpreted *jama* as an [[Inclusivism|inclusivistic|89|wiki]] concept: It means a society open for [[Value_pluralism|pluralism|90|wiki]] and dialogue but does not emphasize that much."

This period is seen formative in Sunni Islam as the founders of the four schools viz, [[Abu_Hanifa|Abu Hanifa|123|wiki]], [[Malik_ibn_Anas|Malik ibn Anas|124|wiki]], [[Shafi'i|Shāfi'i|125|wiki]] and [[Ahmad_ibn_Hanbal|Ahmad bin Hanbal|126|wiki]] all practised during this time, so also did [[Jafar_al_Sadiq|Jafar al Sādiq|127|wiki]] who elaborated the doctrine of [[Imamate|imāmate|128|wiki]], the basis for the Shi'a religious thought. There was no clearly accepted formula for determining succession in the Abbasid caliphate. Two or three sons or other relatives of the dying caliph emerged as candidates to the throne, each supported by his own party of supporters. A trial of strength ensued and the most powerful party won and expected favours of the caliph they supported once he ascended the throne. The caliphate of this dynasty ended with the death of the Caliph al-Ma'mun in 833 CE, when the period of Turkish domination began."

The latest attempt by a radical wing of [[Salafi_jihadism|Salafi-Jihadists|163|wiki]] to re-establish a Sunni caliphate was seen in the emergence of the militant group [[Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant|ISIL|164|wiki]], whose leader [[Abu_Bakr_al-Baghdadi|Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi|165|wiki]] is known among his followers as caliph and *Amir-al-mu'mineen*, \"The Commander of the Faithful\".

Half of the Arab commentaries reject *Isrā'iliyyāt* in general, while Turkish tafsir usually partly allow referring to Biblical material. Nevertheless, most non-Arabic commentators regard them as useless or not applicable. A direct reference to the [[Israeli–Palestinian_conflict|Israeli–Palestinian conflict|171|wiki]] could not be found. It remains unclear whether the refusal of *Isrā'iliyyāt* is motivated by political discourse or by traditionalist thought alone. The usage of *tafsir'ilmi* is another notable characteristic of modern Sunni tafsir. *Tafsir'ilmi* stands for alleged scientific miracles found in the Qur'an. In short, the idea is that the Qur'an contains knowledge about subjects an author of the 7th century could not possibly have. Such interpretations are popular among many commentators. Some scholars, such as the Commentators of [[Al-Azhar_University|Al-Azhar University|172|wiki]], reject this approach, arguing the Qur'an is a text for religious guidance, not for science and scientific theories that may be disproved later; thus *tafsir'ilmi* might lead to interpreting Qur'anic passages as falsehoods. Modern trends of Islamic interpretation are usually seen as adjusting to a modern audience and purifying Islam from alleged alterings, some of which are believed to be intentional corruptions brought into Islam to undermine and corrupt its message."

The Syrian scholar ʿAbd al-Baqi Ibn Faqih Fussa (d. 1661) calls this third traditionalist group the Hanbalites. The late Ottoman thinker İsmail Hakkı İzmirli (d. 1946), who agreed to dividing Sunnis into these three groups, called the traditionalist group [[Salafism|Salafiyya|190|wiki]], but also used *Athariyya* as an alternative term. For the Maturidiyya he gives *Nasafīyya* as a possible alternative name. Another used for the traditionalist-oriented group is \"people of [[Hadith|Hadith|191|wiki]]\" (*ahl al-ḥadīṯ*).

The Sunni, on the other hand, loves ʿAlī in high esteem and is thus in the balanced middle (*al-wasaṭ allaḏī huwa al-qisṭ*). This relates al-Qari to the Qur'anic sura 2: 143, in which it is said that God made the Muslims a community standing in the middle (*umma wasaṭ*). Since the Sunnis stay away from the exaggeration described in the traditional ʿAlī saying, al-Qārī believes that they are also the actual \"[[Shia|Party of ʿAlīs|495|wiki]]\" (šīʿat ʿAlī)."

In [[Indonesia|Indonesia|504|wiki]], the Ashʿarite scholar Sirajuddin Abbas (d. 1980) wrote several books in the 1960s in which he explicitly excluded the *Ahl as-salaf* from Sunnism. Among other things, he argued that there was no Salafi madhhab in the first 300 years of Islam. From this he deduced that those who called other Muslims to obey the Salafi *madhhab*, were promoting a *madhhab* which did not even exist. In his view, only the Ashʿarites were real Sunnis. Abbas' books served as the theological basis for anti-Salafist campaigns in [[Aceh|Aceh|505|wiki]] in 2014. During these campaigns, various Salafist schools in Aceh were closed by the provincial government."

Like many Ashʿarites, the Salafis believe their teachings are the only true form of Sunnism, and hence reject the Asharites and [[Maturidi|Maturidites|507|wiki]] as part of Sunnism. An example is the Saudi scholar [[Muhammad_ibn_al-Uthaymeen|Muhammad Ibn al-ʿUthaimīn|508|wiki]], who in his 2001 published commentary on *Aqīda Wāsiṭīya* by [[Ibn_Taymiyyah|Ibn Taimiyya|509|wiki]] expressed the opinion that Ash'arites and Māturīdites would not count among the Sunnis, because their doctrine of attributes would be in contrast to the doctrine of the Prophet and his companions. For this reason, the view that three groups belong to Sunnism should also be rejected. Sunnis are only those who are *salaf* in terms of belief."

The [[2016_international_conference_on_Sunni_Islam_in_Grozny|first conference|514|wiki]] with the title \"Who are the Ahl al-Sunna wa al-jama?\" took place in the Chechen capital [[Grozny|Grozny|515|wiki]] in August 2016 under the patronage of [[Ramzan_Kadyrov|Ramzan Kadyrov|516|wiki]]. Numerous religious figures from [[Egypt|Egypt|517|wiki]], [[India|India|518|wiki]], [[Syria|Syria|519|wiki]], [[Yemen|Yemen|520|wiki]] and the [[Russian_Federation|Russian Federation|521|wiki]] took part, including [[Ahmed_el-Tayeb|Ahmed el-Tayeb|522|wiki]], the [[Grand_Imam_of_al-Azhar|Grand Imam|523|wiki]] the Azhar, and [[Sheikh_Aboobacker_Ahmed|Sheikh Aboobacker Ahmed|524|wiki]], the [[Grand_Mufti_of_India|Grand Mufti of India|525|wiki]]. According to its organizers, the conference should \"mark a blessed turning point in efforts to correct the serious and dangerous distortion of religion by those extremists trying to usurp the venerable name of *Ahl al-Sunna wa-al-Jama'a*, him to coin exclusively on itself and to exclude its true representatives from it.\" In the final declaration the Salafis and [[Islamism|Islamist|526|wiki]] groups like [[Muslim_Brotherhood|Muslim Brotherhood|527|wiki]], [[Hizb_ut-Tahrir|Hizb ut-Tahrir|528|wiki]], etc. and the *[[Takfiri|Takfiri|529|wiki]]* organisations like [[Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant|ISIL|530|wiki]] were excluded from Sunni Islam. In response to this, various prominent *Salafiyya* figures held a counter-conference in [[Kuwait|Kuwait|531|wiki]] in November 2016 under the title \"The Correct Meaning of Sunnism\" (*al-Mafhūm aṣ-ṣaḥīḥ li-ahl as-sunna wa-l-jama*), in which they also distanced themselves from extremist groups, but at the same time insisted that *Salafiyya* was not only part of Sunnism, but represented Sunnism itself. The conference was chaired by Ahmad ibn Murabit, Grand Mufti of [[Mauritania|Mauritania|532|wiki]]. A few days later, [[Grand_Imam_of_al-Azhar|Grand Imam of Al-Azhar|533|wiki]] [[Ahmed_el-Tayeb|Ahmed el-Tayeb|534|wiki]] publicly distanced himself from the final declaration of the Grozny conference, reiterating that he had not participated in it and stressed that he naturally viewed the Salafists as Sunnis."
