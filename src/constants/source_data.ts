Dowd's system was never accepted by North American railroads. Instead, U.S. and Canadian railroads implemented a version proposed by William F. Allen, the editor of the *Traveler's Official Railway Guide*. The borders of its time zones ran through railroad stations, often in major cities. For example, the border between its Eastern and Central time zones ran through [[Detroit|Detroit|48|wiki]], [[Buffalo,_New_York|Buffalo|49|wiki]], [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh|50|wiki]], [[Atlanta|Atlanta|51|wiki]], and [[Charleston,_South_Carolina|Charleston|52|wiki]].

That works when having telephone or internet meetings. It works less well when travelling, because the calendar events are assumed to take place in the time zone the computer or smartphone was on when creating the event. The event can be shown at the wrong time. For example, if a New Yorker plans to meet someone in Los Angeles at 9 AM, and makes a calendar entry at 9 AM (which the computer assumes is New York time), the calendar entry will be at 6 AM if taking the computer's time zone. There is also an option in newer versions of [[Microsoft_Outlook|Microsoft Outlook|143|wiki]] to enter the time zone in which an event will happen, but often not in other calendar systems. Calendaring software must also deal with [[Daylight_saving_time|daylight saving time|144|wiki]] (DST). If, for political reasons, the begin and end dates of daylight saving time are changed, calendar entries should stay the same in local time, even though they may shift in UTC time. In Microsoft Outlook, time stamps are therefore stored and communicated without DST offsets. Hence, an appointment in London at noon in the summer will be represented as 12:00 (UTC+00:00) even though the event will actually take place at 13:00 UTC. In [[Google_Calendar|Google Calendar|145|wiki]], calendar events are stored in UTC (although shown in local time) and might be changed by a time-zone changes, although normal daylight saving start and end are compensated for (similar to much other calendar software)."
